# Healthcare AI Patient Intake Automation

## Overview
This project automates the patient intake process for healthcare clinics using conversational AI. Patients interact with an AI assistant before their appointment to provide relevant medical information, which is then structured into a clinical document in Notion for healthcare providers.

## Technologies Used
- **ElevenLabs**: Conversational AI for patient interaction
- **n8n**: Workflow automation for document creation
- **Notion**: Database for storing structured patient information
- **Lovable**: Web interface design

## Problem & Solution
### Problem
Traditional patient intake processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and often completed in the waiting room, delaying appointments.

### Solution
An AI-powered conversation collects patient information prior to their visit. The system:
1. Verifies patient identity against scheduled appointments
2. Collects medical information through natural conversation
3. Structures data into a clinical document
4. Makes information available to providers before the appointment
