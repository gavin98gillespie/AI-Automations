# AI-Automations

A collection of advanced AI automation projects and integrations designed to streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and create intelligent systems.

## Featured Projects

### [Healthcare-Patient-Intake](./Healthcare-Patient-Intake)

An AI-powered system that automates the patient intake process for healthcare clinics. Patients interact with a conversational AI assistant after scheduling their appointment to provide medical information before their visit, which is then structured into a clinical document for healthcare providers.

**Key Features:**
- Patient identity verification against scheduled appointments
- Natural conversation for collecting medical history, medications, and symptoms
- Structured clinical documentation generation
- Pre-appointment information access for healthcare providers
- Integration with Notion for organized patient records

### [DeepResearch](./DeepResearch)

An advanced n8n workflow that automates comprehensive research on any topic through recursive exploration, multi-source analysis, and AI-powered synthesis. Inspired by capabilities similar to OpenAI's deep research, this workflow conducts hours of research in minutes.

**Key Features:**
- Recursive topic exploration with configurable depth and breadth
- Multi-stage approach with clarifying questions, query generation, and content analysis
- Automatic web content extraction and analysis
- AI-powered synthesis using advanced LLM reasoning
- Structured report generation in Notion with proper formatting
- Self-directing research that identifies and explores relevant sub-topics
